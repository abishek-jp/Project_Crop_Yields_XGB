This project uses the machine learning approach of extreme gradient boosting to predict crop production by identifying the relationship between other associated features like the state and district of cultivation, 
season at the time of cultivation and area of the cultivated land to predict production in tonnes per hectare. By obtaining production, we can also obtain the yield via the basic mathematical formula of yield=production/area
This model is trained on a vast, diverse and factually correct dataset obtained from www.kaggle.com
